## Purpose of This Tutorial

This tutorial aims to assist developers in creating and customizing battle passes using Whalepass. It covers:

- Configuring tiers and rewards.
- Integrating battlepass seamlessly into your game.

---

## 1. What is a Battlepass?

A battlepass is a progression system used in games to reward players for completing specific challenges or activities. It typically includes:

### Key Features

- **Tiers or Levels**  
  Players progress through tiers by earning points or XP.  
  Each tier unlocks rewards such as in-game items, currency, or exclusive content.

- **Time-Limited Access**  
  Battle passes are often available for a specific season or event.  
  This encourages players to engage consistently within a set timeframe.

- **Rewards System**  
  Rewards are divided into free and premium tracks.  
  The premium track requires a purchase to unlock additional rewards.

To enroll a player in your Battlepass:

- Send the player's **playerId** and **gameId**.
- **Idempotency**: Repeated requests with the same playerId will not create duplicates.

---

### 2. Incrementing XP for Player Progression

Players progress in their Battlepass by earning XP. Two methods are available:

#### Method 1: Directly Increment XP (Hardcode Method)

- Use the API to manually add XP to a player's account.
- **Endpoint**: [XP Hardcode API Documentation](https://www.whalepass.gg/documentation/exp_hardcode).

#### Method 2: Assign XP via Game Actions (Softcode Method)

- Create specific in-game actions to dynamically reward XP. Examples:
  - Completing a level.
  - Defeating a boss.
  - Achieving a milestone.
- **Endpoint**: [XP Softcode API Documentation](https://www.whalepass.gg/documentation/exp_softcode).

---

### 3. Completing Challenges for Players

**Endpoint**: [Player Challenge API Documentation](https://www.whalepass.gg/documentation/player_challenge)  
Mark challenges as completed by sending:

- **playerId**: The ID of the player.
- **challengeId**: The ID of the challenge.

This updates the player's progress and rewards them.

---

### 4. Getting Player Progress

Retrieve detailed information about a player's current progress in their Battlepass:

- **Endpoint**: [Get Player Progress API Documentation](https://www.whalepass.gg/documentation/get_player_progress).

What you can retrieve:
- Overall progress toward completing the Battlepass.
- Levels and their unlock status.
- Challenges and their completion status.

#### Alternative: Basic Player Progress

- Use a simplified API for core progress details (e.g., no levels or challenges).  
  - **Endpoint**: [Get Player Progress Base API Documentation](https://www.whalepass.gg/documentation/get_player_progress_base).

---

### 5. Getting Player Inventory

### 6. Redirecting Players to Discover.Games

Redirect players to manage their on-chain rewards and explore other games:

**Important Note**:  
- Each link is user-specific and expires after a set time.
